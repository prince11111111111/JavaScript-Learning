# My JavaScript Journey 

This repository is a collection of my early projects. It’s my personal playground where I figured out how to handle user inputs, manage logic, and make things happen on a screen. 

These projects helped me move from basic fundamentals to building interactive logic-heavy tools.

###  The Projects

* **GPA Calculator:** Focused on mathematical logic and handling multiple numeric inputs.
* **Tic-Tac-Toe:** A deep dive into game states, turn-based logic, and win-condition checks.
* **Rock Paper Scissors:** Practicing randomization and DOM updates based on user choice.
* **Currency Converter:** Learning how to manage data conversion and dropdown selections.

###  Skills I Practiced

* **DOM Manipulation:** Making the webpage react when a user clicks or types.
* **Event Listeners:** Capturing user actions like button presses and keyboard events.
* **Logic & Conditionals:** Writing the "brain" of the apps to handle various outcomes.
* **Mobile Basics:** Ensuring the layouts don't break on smaller screens.
